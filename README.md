# Image-Segmentation-using-Neural-Networks

This is a simple project that performs Image Segmentation using Neural networks

Requirements:
-------------
Segmentation tasks are performed using a AWS GPU instance.

Results:
-------
- Multi-label segmentation on images using deep-learning models.
- Used a pre-trained convolutional neural network model which is actually a keras model and tested it on a smaller dataset of images. 
- Labelled every random image picked up by the model with its corresponding annotations.
